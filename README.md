# codewars-remove-followers

On Codewars, you're forced to unfollow users one-by-one. This project does it for you!

**Step 1: Install dependencies**

```sh
yarn
```

**Step 2: Enter your Codewars email and password**

Enter your email address and password inside `login.json`. (Make sure not to upload this anywhere!)

**Step 3: Start**

```
yarn start
```

Wait a few minutes (depending on your number of followers), and you're done!
